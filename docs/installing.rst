Installation
================

RIVET is available at https://github.com/rivetTDA/rivet.


Requirements
------------

Before starting to build RIVET, you will need to have the following installed:
 
* A C++ compiler (g++ or clang are what we use)
* CMake
* Qt 5
* Boost (version 1.58 or newer)

Below we give step-by-step instructions for installing these required dependencies and building RIVET on Ubuntu and Mac OS X.  Building RIVET on Windows is not yet supported, but it is possible to build RIVET using the Bash shell on Windows 10.

Building On Ubuntu
------------------

Installing Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Ubuntu, installation of dependencies should be relatively simple::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install cmake qt5-default qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools libboost-all-dev

Building RIVET 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After `cloning <https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/>`_ to ``$RIVET_DIR``::

    cd $RIVET_DIR
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    cd .. 
    qmake 
    make

You may see compiler warnings during either of the ``make`` executions.
These can safely be ignored. 

After this, you will have two executables built: the viewer (rivet_GUI), and the computation engine (rivet_console).

It is then necessary to move or symlink the console into the same folder where the viewer was built. On Ubuntu and most other systems::

    ln -s build/rivet_console
    
In the future, all these steps will be automated so that a single cmake build will create both executables, and put everything in the right place.  


Building On Mac OS X
--------------------

Installing Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, ensure you have the XCode Command Line Tools installed by running::

    # only needed if you've never run it before, (running it again doesn't hurt anything)
    # installs XCode Command Line Tools
    xcode-select --install
    
If a popup window appears, click the "Install" button, and accept the license agreement.  

Next, install XCode from the App Store, if you've not done so already.  You will also need accept the license agreement for XCode, which you can do from the command line by running::

    sudo xcodebuild -license

To install the remaining packages, we recommend using the package manager [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).  To install Homebrew::

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"    
    
Now install cmake, qt5, and boost::
    
    brew install cmake qt5 boost
    


Building RIVET
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Please note that part of the build requires the use of ``qmake``, and you might very well have a version of ``qmake`` in your ``PATH`` that is not for Qt 5, but for an older version. In the steps below, we assume ``$QT_BASE`` is the installation folder for Qt 5.

As of the time of writing, ``brew`` installs ``qmake`` in a version-specific folder under 
``/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/[my_version_#]/bin``, and does not add it to your ``PATH``. You can find
the folder where qt5 is installed using this command::

    brew info qt5 | grep Cellar | cut -d' ' -f1

In fact, let's store that in a variable so we can use it below::
    
    export QT_BASE=`brew info qt5 | grep Cellar | cut -d' ' -f1`

In order to ensure that ``qmake`` can find where Boost is installed, add the following lines to the bottom of the file RIVET.pro, changing the paths in the last three lines, if necessary, to match the location and version of your copy of Boost.  ::

    CONFIG += c++11
    QMAKE_CFLAGS += -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -mmacosx-version-min=10.9
    QMAKE_CXXFLAGS += -std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -mmacosx-version-min=10.9

    LIBS += -L"/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.63.0/lib"
    INCLUDEPATH += "/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.63.0/include"

    LIBS += -L"/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.63.0/lib" -lboost_random

After `cloning <https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/>`_ to ``$RIVET_DIR``::

    cd $RIVET_DIR
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    cd .. 
    $QT_BASE/bin/qmake
    make    
    
You may see compiler warnings during either of the ``make`` executions.
These can safely be ignored. 

After this, you will have two executables built: the viewer (rivet_GUI.app), and the computation engine (rivet_console).
   
It is then necessary to move or symlink the console into the same folder where the viewer was built::

    cd rivet_GUI.app/Contents/MacOS
    ln -s ../../../build/rivet_console   

In the future, all these steps will be automated so that a single ``cmake`` build will create both executables, and put everything in the right place.

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our experience has been that if Homebrew is installed before XCode, then running qmake during the build process returns an error::

    Project ERROR: Could not resolve SDK Path for 'macosx'
    
To solve the problem, try running::   

    sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer


Building in the Bash Shell on Windows 10
----------------------------------------

First, ensure that you have the `Windows 10 Creators Update <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/d4efb316-79f0-1aa1-9ef3-dcada78f3fa0/get-the-windows-10-creators-update>`_.
Then activate the `Windows 10 Bash Shell <https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/>`_.
This will provide a Bash shell with Ubuntu 16.04 inside of Windows 10.

Open the Bash shell and install dependencies. Use the following command to install cmake, a compiler, and Qt5::

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install cmake build-essential qt5-default qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools libboost-all-dev

In order to use the RIVET viewer, you must install an X server such as `Xming <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/>`_.

It is probably also necessary to set an environment variable, as follows::

    export DISPLAY=:0

This environment variable will be reset when you close the Bash shell. To avoid having to run the line above when you reopen the shell, add this line to the end of the file ``~/.bashrc``.

You are now ready to build RIVET. Follow the instructions in the section :ref:`buildingOnUbuntu`.
